<h1>Day-to-Day Physiotherapy Exercises</h1>

<div class="exercise">
    <h2>1. Deep Breathing Exercise</h2>
    <p><strong>Procedure:</strong> Sit or stand comfortably. Inhale deeply through your nose, filling your lungs with air. Hold your breath for a few seconds, then exhale slowly through your mouth, emptying your lungs completely.</p>
    <p><strong>Uses:</strong> Deep breathing exercises help improve lung capacity, increase oxygen intake, reduce stress, and promote relaxation.</p>
</div>

<div class="exercise">
    <h2>2. Neck Stretching</h2>
    <p><strong>Procedure:</strong> Sit or stand tall. Slowly tilt your head to one side, bringing your ear towards your shoulder. Hold for 15-30 seconds, then repeat on the other side.</p>
    <p><strong>Uses:</strong> Neck stretching exercises help relieve tension, improve flexibility, and reduce stiffness in the neck muscles.</p>
</div>

<div class="exercise">
    <h2>3. Shoulder Rolls</h2>
    <p><strong>Procedure:</strong> Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Roll your shoulders forward in a circular motion, making big circles. Repeat for 10-15 times, then reverse the direction and roll your shoulders backward.</p>
    <p><strong>Uses:</strong> Shoulder rolls help improve shoulder mobility, relieve tension in the shoulder muscles, and prevent stiffness.</p>
</div>

<div class="exercise">
    <h2>4. Leg Raises</h2>
    <p><strong>Procedure:</strong> Lie flat on your back with your legs straight. Lift one leg off the ground, keeping it straight, until it reaches a 45-degree angle with the floor. Hold for a few seconds, then slowly lower it back down. Repeat with the other leg.</p>
    <p><strong>Uses:</strong> Leg raises strengthen the abdominal muscles, hip flexors, and quadriceps, improve core stability, and enhance balance.</p>
</div>

<div class="exercise">
    <h2>5. Ankle Circles</h2>
    <p><strong>Procedure:</strong> Sit on a chair with your feet flat on the floor. Lift one foot off the ground and rotate your ankle in a circular motion, first clockwise and then counterclockwise. Repeat with the other foot.</p>
    <p><strong>Uses:</strong> Ankle circles help improve ankle flexibility, reduce stiffness, and prevent ankle injuries.</p>
